## Project Instructions
For this project you will create an app, written entirely in Objective-C, that makes use of UICollectionViews, Asynchronous Networking, Gestures and Transitions.

You are welcome to select a domain of your choice, and to incorporate other features and tools, but please make sure the four required items listed above are implemented. In addition, the collection view cells must be interactive and networking should make use of proper error handling. Below are a few examples and ideas of apps that can be built. We suggest picking a content area that excites you and will make for a good portfolio piece.
